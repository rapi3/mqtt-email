Dahua EZIP camera when detect motion send email message (encoded) in this format:
```
Alarm Event: Motion Detection Start
Alarm Input Channel: 1
Alarm Start Time(D/M/Y H:M:S): 21/12/2021 22:15:33
Alarm Device Name: EZIP08
Alarm Name: 
IP Address: 192.168.2.155
```
we need to search for first line: "Alarm Event: Motion Detection Start"<br>
encoded will be: "QWxhcm0gRXZlbnQ6IE1vdGlvbiBEZXRlY3Rpb24gU3RhcnQ"

Dahua IPC camera when detect motion send email message (encoded) in this format:
```
Alarm Event: Motion Detection
Alarm Input Channel: 1
Alarm Start Time(D/M/Y H:M:S): 23/12/2021 10:27:46
Alarm Device Name: IPC06
Alarm Name: 
IP Address: 192.168.2.164
```
we need to search for first line and part of seccond line.<br>
encoded will be: "QWxhcm0gRXZlbnQ6IE1vdGlvbiBEZXRlY3Rpb24NCkFsYXJtIElucHV0IENoYW5uZWw"

No Name camera when detect motion send email message (not encoded) in this format:
```
	This is an automatically generated e-mail from your IPC.

		EVENT TYPE: Motion Detected
		EVENT TIME: 27/12/2021 17:42:19
		IPC NAME: IPC
		CHANNEL NUMBER: 01
		IPC IP: 192.168.2.111
```
we need to search for first line: "EVENT TYPE: Motion Detected"<br>

when string it is found script will publish message <b>Alarm</b> in camera named topic: <b>IOT/cctv/ez08</b><br>
sender-name it is taken from cctv email:
```
Return-Path: <ez08@myhome.local
```
so you can have any nr of cameras sending messages to that email box and each camera will have his own topic.

# You need to add in code your MQTT server IP, user & password
# Postfix

this is required for script to be executed when mailbox usercctv will receive mail:<br>

add in /etc/aliases<br>
usercctv: |/etc/postfix/script/mqtt-email.py<br>

Don't forget to: postalias /etc/aliases and afterwards reload Postfix with postfix reload<br>

----
## Home Assistant - optional
you need to create binary sensor motion for every camera<br>
There is no need to send message when Alarm is off because the sensor created will auto change state to off after 60s
```
# CCTV EZIP08 Alarm

  state_topic: "IOT/cctv/ez08"
